Hello! This is my first project in Machine Learning. I made a Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classifier with Convolutional Neural Network using Python and TensorFlow.
The datasets of Images are taken from Kaggle with some modificationn by DICODING Indonesia (Initially, I made this project as my course's submission there).
I made it using Google Colab (Well cuz it's free with high computational processing, compared to my computer).
The details are in the python notebook file~
